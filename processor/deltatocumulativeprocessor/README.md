## Description

The delta to cumulative processor (`deltatocumulativeprocessor`) converts
metrics from delta temporality to cumulative, by accumulating samples in memory.

## Configuration

``` yaml
processors:
    deltatocumulative:
        # how long until a series not receiving new samples is removed
        [ max_stale: <duration> | default = 5m ]
```

There is no further configuration required. All delta samples are converted to cumulative.

## Troubleshooting

The following metrics are recorded when [telemetry is
enabled](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#telemetry):

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `deltatocumulative_streams_count`        | Number of streams currently tracked by the aggregation state                          |         |
| `deltatocumulative_datapoints_processed` | Total number of datapoints processed, whether successful or not                       |         |
| `deltatocumulative_datapoints_dropped`   | Faulty datapoints that were dropped due to the reason given in the `reason` attribute |         |
| `deltatocumulative_seconds_lost`         | Total length of all gaps in the streams, which occur e.g. due to lost in transit      | seconds |
