The Remote Tap processor a.k.a. WebSocket processor can be positioned anywhere
in a pipeline. It allows data to pass through to the next component.
Simultaneously, it makes a portion of the data accessible to WebSocket clients
connecting on a configurable port. This functionality resembles that of the
Unix `tee` command, which enables data to flow through while duplicating and
redirecting it for inspection.

The telemetry stream may be captured with any WebSockets client.

To avoid overloading clients, the amount of telemetry duplicated over 
any open WebSockets is rate limited by an adjustable amount.

The `remotetap` processor registers with the [`remotetap`
extension](../../extension/remotetapextension)` extension if it is enabled,
allowing telemetry to be viewed interactively via a browser.

## Config

The `remotetap` WebSocket processor one processor-specific configurable field:

- `limit`: The rate limit over the WebSocket in messages per second. Can be a
  float or an integer. Optional. Defaults to `1`.

It also takes [the same arguments as other generic HTTP listening
services](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp)
including:

- `endpoint`: Address on which to listen for incoming WebSocket connections.

  Defaults to `0.0.0.0:12001` unless the `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost`
  feature gate is enabled in which case it defaults to `localhost:12001`.

  New deployments should explicitly set the feature gate and/or explicitly set
  `endpoint: "localhost:12001"`

TLS, authentication etc are all configured via the generic HTTP server options.
By default TLS is not enabled and no authentication is required.

Example configuration:

```yaml
processors:
  remotetap:
    websocket:
      # Listen address
      endpoint: "localhost:12001"
      # rate limit 1 msg/sec
      limit: 1
```

## Connecting with a WebSocket client

The `remotetap` processor listens passively for WebSockets connections. CLI
tools like [`websocat`](https://github.com/vi/websocat) are useful.

When the collector is running in a containerized environment it may be
necessary to explicitly expose or port-forward the listening `remotetap` port.
