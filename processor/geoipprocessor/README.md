**This processor is currently under development and is presently a NOP (No Operation) processor. Further features and functionalities will be added in upcoming versions.**

## Description

The geoIP processor `geoipprocessor` enhances resource attributes by appending information about the geographical location of an IP addresses. The IP address must be included in the resource attributes for the geographical information to be added accordingly.

## Configuration

The following settings must configured:

- `fields`: A list of resource attribute keys where the IP address will be searched for. The first matched key will be used to append the geographical location.

#### Examples

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: geoip
    geoip:
        fields:
          - host.ip
          - ip
```
