# If your change doesn't affect end users, such as a test fix or a tooling change,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.

component: zipkintranslator

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Stop dropping error tags from Zipkin spans. The old code removes all errors from those spans, rendering them useless if an actual error happened. In addition, no longer delete error tags if they contain useful information.

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
