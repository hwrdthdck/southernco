    Restores the previous the default value of `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator will emit the
    first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). This fixes the bug introduced by 30783 and restores
    the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug for users who were not using this setting.
    For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`, this corrects the intended behavior.
# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
