# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: "Google Cloud Spanner Receiver currently generates an exception and exits if it attempts to read data from a database that doesn't exist. However it's normal for a single receiver to poll multiple databases, so this is not graceful failure. This PR makes a change to gracefully generate an error in case of an unreadable missing database and then continue reading other databases.."
