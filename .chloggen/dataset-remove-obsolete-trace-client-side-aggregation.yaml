  This pull request removes the following attributes from the DataSet trace events: services, 
  span_count, error_count. Those attributes were populated on the client side as part of the client
  side aggregation code. This client side aggregation was meant as a temporary solution until a
  proper solution is implement on the server side. Being a temporary solution meant it had many
  edge cases and would only work under specific and limited circumstances (all spans which belong
  to a trace are part of the same batch received by the plugin).

  Corresponding config options (traces.aggregate and traces.max_wait) which are not redundant and
  unused have also been removed.
