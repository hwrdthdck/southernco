  Add a `retry_on_failure` config option (disabled by default) that can be used to slow down reading logs instead of 
  dropping logs if downstream components return a non-permanent error. The configuration has the following options:
    - `enabled`: Enable or disable the retry mechanism. Default is `false`.
    - `initial_interval`: The initial interval to wait before retrying. Default is `1s`.
    - `max_interval`: The maximum interval to wait before retrying. Default is `30s`.
    - `max_elapsed_time`: The maximum amount of time to wait before giving up. Default is `5m`.
