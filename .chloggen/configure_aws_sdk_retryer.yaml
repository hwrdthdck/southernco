  In some cases, you might need to change the behavior of the AWS metadata client from the [standard retryer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/configure-retries-timeouts.html)
  
  By default, the client retries 3 times with a max backoff delay of 20s.

  We offer a limited set of options to override those defaults specifically, such that you can set the client to retry 10 times, for up to 5 minutes, for example:
  ```yaml
  processors:
    resourcedetection/ec2:
      detectors: ["ec2"]
      ec2:
        max_attempts: 10
        max_backoff: 5m
  ```

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
