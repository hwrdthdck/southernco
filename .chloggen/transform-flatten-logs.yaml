# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [32080]

  This option is useful when applying transformations which alter the resource or scope. e.g. `set(resource.attributes["to"], attributes["from"])`, which may otherwise result in unexpected behavior. Using this option typically incurs a performance penalty as the processor must compute many hashes and create copies of resource and scope information for every log record.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
