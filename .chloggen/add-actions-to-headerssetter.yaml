  Please update configurations to use the action that suits your requirements:
    - `insert`: Inserts the new header if it does not exist.
    - `update`: Updates the header value if it exists.
    - `upsert`: Inserts a header if it does not exist and updates the header
       if it exists.
    - `delete`: Deletes the header.
  The default action is `upsert`, however, in future versions, we'll require this
  to be explicitly set.
