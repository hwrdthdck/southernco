  Fixed a potential panic due to a syscall indicating a that the event buffer should resize to 0. The next used of that resized buffer would result in an index out of bounds panic.

  Also, added a safety check for buffer resize cases that if the syscall indicates it needs the buffer size to be 0, an error will be returned.
