      This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
      Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
      This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.
      For reference, see the calculations [here](https://superuser.com/a/980821).
      See also `MemAvailable` in [/proc/meminfo](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).
