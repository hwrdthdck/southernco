  Currently OTTL provides no way to use any defined Converter within another Editor/Converter.
  Although Converters can be passed as a parameter, they are always executed and the result is what is actually passed as the parameter.
  This allows OTTL to pass Converters themselves as a parameter so they can be executed within the function.
