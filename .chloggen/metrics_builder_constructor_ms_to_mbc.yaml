  Currently, the only way to add configurative functionality to mdatagen is by using a bunch of WithResourceAttributesSettings options to the constructor.
  This PR changes the first argument to the NewMetricsBuilder constructor to be of type MetricsBuilderConfig,
  which is a new class that wraps both MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings, and may be (hopefully) easily extended with more
  configuration in the future.
