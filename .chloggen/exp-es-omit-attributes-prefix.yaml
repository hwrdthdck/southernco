  Setting `mapping.mode: raw` in the Elasticsearch exporter's configuration
  will result logs and traces being indexed into Elasticsearch with their
  attribute fields directly at the root level of the document instead inside an
  `Attributes` object. Similarly, this setting will also result in traces being
  indexed into Elasticsearch with their event fields directly at the root level
  of the document instead of inside an `Events` object.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
