  As a result of this change non-zero values of `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_trace_dropped_too_early`
  and `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_policy_evaluation_error_total` metrics will be lower.
  Before this fix, errors got counted several times depending on the amount of traces being processed
  that tick and where in the batch the error happened.
  Zero values are unaffected.
