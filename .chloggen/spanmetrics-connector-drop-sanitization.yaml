component: spanmetricsconnector

note: Drop Prometheus-specific metrics labels sanitization.

issues: [18678]

subtext: |
  The spanmeterics connector is the OTel component, therefore, we would
  like to strip Prometheus-specific parts from it. Metric names and attributes
  conversion to Prometheus conventions should happen in Prometheus components,
  e.g. Prometheus Remote Write exporter.
