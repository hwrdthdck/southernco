  Users can now configure what resource attributes are gathered by specific detectors.
  Example configuration:
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system, ec2]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: true
        host.id:
          enabled: false
    ec2:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: false
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```
  
  For example, this config makes `host.name` being set by `system` detector, and `host.id` by `ec2` detector.
  Moreover:
  - Existing behavior remains unaffected as all attributes are currently enabled by default.
  - The default attributes 'enabled' values are defined in `metadata.yaml`.
  - Future releases will introduce changes to resource_attributes `enabled` values.
  - Users can tailor resource detection process to their needs and environment.
