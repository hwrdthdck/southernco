  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:

  - `process.memory.physical_usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual_usage`

  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:

  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`

  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.
