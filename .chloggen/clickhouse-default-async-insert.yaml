  Adds `async_insert` config option to enable inserting asynchronously by default.
  To preserve the previous behavior, set `async_insert` to `false` in your config.
  When enabled, the exporter will insert asynchronously, which can improve performance for high-throughput deployments.
  The `async_insert` option can be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable async inserts, respectively. The default value is `true`.
  Keep in mind this setting is added since the exporter now sets it to default.
  Async insert and its related settings can still be defined in `endpoint` and `connection_params`, which take priority over the new config option.

  This set of changes also includes and internal change for `create_schema`, which no longer uses a `bool` pointer.
  It also changes `database` to `default`. The final database will prioritize `endpoint`, unless `database` is set to a value not equal to `default`.
  If neither are specified then it defaults to the `default` database.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
