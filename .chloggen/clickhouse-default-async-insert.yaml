  This change enables async inserts by default, and adds new `async_insert` config option.
  When enabled, the exporter will insert asynchronously, which can improve performance for high-throughput deployments.
  The `async_insert` option can be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable async inserts, respectively. The default value is `true`.
  Keep in mind this setting is added since the exporter now sets it to default.
  Async insert and its related settings can still be defined in `endpoint` and `connection_params`, which take priority over the new config option.
