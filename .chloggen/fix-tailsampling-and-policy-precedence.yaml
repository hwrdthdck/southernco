note: Fix precedence of inverted match in and policy
issues: [33671]
subtext: |
  Previously if the decision from a policy evaluation was `NotSampled` or `InvertNotSampled` it would return a `NotSampled` decision regardless, effectively downgrading the result.

  This was breaking the documented behaviour that inverted decisions should take precedence over all others.
