subtext:
  This is a breaking change only because removing the attributes would prevent
  collector startup if those attributes are specified, but otherwise there is
  no functional change. These configuration attributes have never done anything.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
