The Git Provider receiver scrapes data from Git vendors.

As a starting point, this receiver can infer many of the same core git metrics across vendors, while being able to receive additional data specific to vendors.

The current default set of metrics common across all vendors can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md).

These default metrics can be used as leading indicators to the DORA metrics; helping provide insight into modern-day engineering practices.

## GitHub Scraper

The current metrics available via scraping from GitHub are:

- [x] Repository count
- [x] Repository contributor count
- [x] Repository branch count
- [x] Repository branch time
- [x] Repository branch commit aheadby count
- [x] Repository branch commit behindby count
- [x] Repository branch line addition count
- [x] Repository branch line deletion count
- [x] Repository pull request open time
- [x] Repository pull request time to merge
- [x] Repository pull request time to approval
- [x] Repository pull request count | stores an attribute of `pull_request.state` equal to `open` or `merged`

> Note: Some metrics may be disabled by default and have to be explicitly enabled.
> For example, the repository contributor count metric is one such metric. This is
> because this metric relies on the REST API which is subject to lower rate limits.

### Limitations

The GitHub scraper is reliant on limitations found within GitHub's REST and
GraphQL APIs. The following limitations are known:

* The original creation date of a branch is not available via either of the
  APIs. GitSCM (the  tool) does provide Ref creation time however this is not
  exposed. As such, we're forced to calculate the age by looking to see if any
  changes have been made to the branch, using that commit as the time from
  which we can grab the date. This means that age will reflect the time between
  now and the first commit on a new branch. It also means that we don't have
  ages for branches that have been created from trunk but have not had any
  changes made to them.
* It's possible that some queries may run against a branch that has been
  deleted. This is unlikely due to the speed of the requests, however,
  possible.
* Both APIs have primary and secondary rate limits applied to them. The default
  rate limit for GraphQL API is 5,000 points per hour when authenticated with a
  user personal access toke (PAT). If using the [GitHub App Auth
  extension][ghext] then your rate limit increases to 10,000. The receiver on
  average costs 4 points per repository, allowing it to scrape up to 1250
  repositories per hour under normal conditions. Given this average cost a good
  collection interval in seconds is:

```math
\text{collection\_interval (seconds)} = \frac{4n}{r/3600} + 300
```

```math
\begin{aligned}
    \text{where:} \\
    n &= \text{number of repositories} \\
    r &= \text{hourly rate limit} \\
\end{aligned}
```

$r$ is likely 5000 but there are factors that can change this,
for more information see [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/rate-limits-and-node-limits-for-the-graphql-api#primary-rate-limit).
The $300$ is a buffer to account for this being a rough estimate and to account
for the initial query to grab repositories.

In addition to these primary rate limits, GitHub enforces secondary rate limits
to prevent abuse and maintain API availability. The following secondary limit is
particularly relevant:

- **Concurrent Requests Limit**: The API allows no more than 100 concurrent
requests. This limit is shared across the REST and GraphQL APIs. Since the
scraper creates a goroutine per repository, having more than 100 repositories
returned by the `search_query` will result in exceeding this limit.
It is recommended to use the `search_query` config option to limit the number of
repositories that are scraped. We recommend one instance of the receiver per
team (note: `team` is not a valid quantifier when searching repositories `topic`
is). Reminder that each instance of the receiver should have its own
corresponding token for authentication as this is what rate limits are tied to.

In summary, we recommend the following:

- One instance of the receiver per team
- Each instance of the receiver should have its own token
- Leverage `search_query` config option to limit repositories returned to 100 or
less per instance
- `collection_interval` should be long enough to avoid rate limiting (see above
formula), recall these are lagging indicators so a longer interval is acceptable.

## Getting Started

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

> Note: Generally speaking, if the vendor allows for anonymous API calls, then you
> won't have to configure any authentication, but you may only see public repositories
> and organizations. You may run into significantly more rate limiting.

```yaml
gitprovider:
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s recommended 300s
    scrapers:
        <scraper1>:
        <scraper2>:
        ...
```

A more complete example using the GitHub & GitLab scrapers with authentication is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
    bearertokenauth/github:
        token: ${env:GH_PAT}

receivers:
    gitprovider:
        initial_delay: 1s
        collection_interval: 60s
        scrapers:
            github:
                metrics:
                    git.repository.contributor.count:
                        enabled: true
                github_org: myfancyorg
                search_query: "org:myfancyorg topic:o11yalltheway" #Recommended optional query override, defaults to "{org,user}:<github_org>"
                endpoint: "https://selfmanagedenterpriseserver.com"
                auth:
                    authenticator: bearertokenauth/github
service:
    extensions: [bearertokenauth/github]
    pipelines:
        metrics:
            receivers: [..., gitprovider]
            processors: []
            exporters: [...]
```

This receiver is developed upstream in the [liatrio-otel-collector distribution](https://github.com/liatrio/liatrio-otel-collector)
where a quick start exists with an [example config](https://github.com/liatrio/liatrio-otel-collector/blob/main/config/config.yaml)

A Grafana Dashboard exists on the marketplace for this receiver and can be
found [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20976-engineering-effectiveness-metrics/).
