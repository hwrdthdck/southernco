The Git Metrics receiver generates metrics from Git about Git repositories and 
organizations from various vendor endpoints. It is intended to be used
when the collector is deployed as an agent, scraping over a given interval of
time.

## Getting Started

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

```yaml
gitmetrics:
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s
    scrapers:
        <scraper1>:
        <scraper2>:
        ...
```

The available scrapers are:
