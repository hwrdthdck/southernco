This receiver accepts [metrics](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/metrics) data from the [HTTP Emitter](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#http-emitter-module) of Apache Druid.

## Prerequisites

Apache Druid cluster needs to be configured to enable metrics, see [Enabling Metrics](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#enabling-metrics) and the [HTTP Emitter Module](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#http-emitter-module).

## Configuration

The following configuration options are supported:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:9000) HTTP service endpoint for the line protocol receiver
- `metrics_path` (default = `/services/collector/metrics`) The path accepting Apache Druid metrics.
- `logs_path` (default = `/services/collector/logs`) The path accepting Apache Druid logs.
- `cluster_name` (default = `default`) The default name of Druid cluster. Note that the [HTTP Emitter](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#http-emitter-module) of Apache Druid `28.0.0` doesn't include cluster name information in metrics.

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented in [config.go](config.go).

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  apachedruid:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9000
```

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml)
