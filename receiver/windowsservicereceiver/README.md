The Windows Service Receiver is a receiver for scraping information about services running on a Windows machine.

## Getting Started

By default the Windows Service Receiver will attempt to identify and monitor the status of all specified services on the host machine.
 This behavior can be changed by a user setting the `monitor_all` field to true which will tell the receiver to attempt to build a list
 and monitor the status of all services present on the host machine. The collection interval for the receiver may also be modified by 
 specifying a value. Default collection interval is every one minute.

An example of monitoring three services on a host:
```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  services:
    - service1
    - service2
    - service3
    ...
```
The case where you wish to monitor all services present on a host machine:
```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  monitor_all: true
    ...
```
