The File Stats receiver collects metrics from files specified with a glob pattern.

## Configuration
- `include` (required): The glob path for files to watch
- `collection_interval` (default = `1m`): The interval at which metrics are emitted by this receiver.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

See [documentation.md] for a list of the metrics collected.
