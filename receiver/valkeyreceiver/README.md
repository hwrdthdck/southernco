The Valkey receiver is designed to retrieve Valkey INFO data from a single
Valkey instance, build metrics from that data, and send them to the next consumer at a
configurable interval.

## Details

The Valkey INFO command returns information and statistics about a Valkey
server (see [https://valkey.io/commands/info/](https://valkey.io/commands/info/) for
details). The Valkey receiver extracts values from the result and converts them to open
telemetry metrics. Details about the metrics produced by the Valkey receiver
can be found by browsing [the metadata file](./metadata.yaml).

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (no default): The hostname and port of the Valkey instance,
separated by a colon.

The following settings are optional:

- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): This receiver runs on an interval.
Each time it runs, it queries Valkey, creates metrics, and sends them to the
next consumer. The `collection_interval` configuration option tells this
receiver the duration between runs. This value must be a string readable by
Golang's `ParseDuration` function (example: `1h30m`). Valid time units are
`ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `tls`: see [TLS Configuration Settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md#tls-configuration-settings) for the full set of available options.

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  valkey:
    endpoint: "localhost:6379"
    collection_interval: 10s
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go).
