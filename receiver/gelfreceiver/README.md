Receives GELF logs over UDP.

## Configuration Fields

| Field                     | Default              | Description                                                                                                        |
| ---                       | ---                  | ---                                                                                                                |
| `listen_address`          | 0.0.0.0:31250             | A listen address of the form `<ip>:<port>`                                                                         |
| `protocol`              | udp                  | Only supports UDP right now, support for TCP is pending                                                      |
| `async_readers`      | 1                | Skip log tokenization, set to true if logs contains one log per record and multiline is not used.  This will improve performance.                                                 |
| `async_processors`                | 1                   | A map of `key: value` pairs to add to the entry's resource                                                         |
| `udp_max_queue_length`          | 100                | Determines max length of channel being used by async reader routines. When channel reaches max number, reader routine will block until channel has room. |
| `enable_short_and_full_message` | false | When set to true, both short and full message fields will be enabled in the log attributes. |
| `enable_gelf_raw_message`       | false | When set to true, the raw GELF message will be included in the log attributes. |
| `operators`               | []                   | An array of [operators](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/README.md#what-operators-are-available). See below for more details |

### Operators

Each operator performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

### Parsers with Embedded Operations

Many parsers operators can be configured to embed certain followup operations such as timestamp and severity parsing. For more information, see [complex parsers](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/parsers.md#complex-parsers).

#### `async_readers` and `async_processors` configuration

| Field                                   | Default              | Description |
| ---                                     | ---                  | ---         |
| `async_readers`                               | 1                    | Concurrency level - Determines how many go routines read from UDP port and push to channel (to be handled by processors). |
| `async_processors`                            | 1                    | Concurrency level - Determines how many go routines read from channel (pushed by readers) and process logs (process logs means GELF format to OpenTelemetry Collector format) before sending downstream. |
| `udp_max_queue_length`                      | 100                  | Determines max length of channel being used by async reader routines. When channel reaches max number, reader routine will block until channel has room. |

## Example Configurations

### Simple

Configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  gelfreceiver:
    listen_address: "0.0.0.0:12201"
    protocol: udp
    async_readers: 3
    async_processors: 3
    udp_max_queue_length: 10000
```
