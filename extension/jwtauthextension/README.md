## Description

The JWT auth extensions implements a `configauth.ServerAuthenticator`, to be used in receivers inside the `auth` settings. The authenticator type has to be set to `jwt`.
The incoming request is expected to have a `Authorization` header, with a value of `Bearer <token>`. The token is then validated using the configured `secret` setting.
Currently, only HS256 is supported. We enrich the client context field `Auth` with the claims from the token. You can use this information in a processor like [`attributesprocessor`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/attributesprocessor) to filter or enrich the data.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `secret` (string): The secret used to validate the token. You can also use an environment variable `${ENV_VAR_NAME}`.
- `attribute` (string): The header name to look for auth data. Defaults to `authorization`.
