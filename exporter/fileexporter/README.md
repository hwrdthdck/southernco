Exporter supports the following featuresï¼š

+ Support for writing pipeline data to a JSON file.
+ Support for rotation of telemetry files.

The data is written in.[Protobuf JSON encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). using [OpenTelemetry protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto).



Please note that there is no guarantee that exact field names will remain stable.
This intended for primarily for debugging Collector without setting up backends.

## Getting Started

The following settings are required:
- `path` (no default): where to write information.

The following settings are optional:
- `rotation` settings to rotate telemetry files.
    - max_size:  [default: 100]: the maximum size in megabytes of the telemetry file before it is rotated.
    - max_days: [no default (unlimited)]: the maximum number of days to retain telemetry files based on the timestamp encoded in their filename.
    - max_backups: [no default (unlimited)]: the maximum number of old telemetry files to retain.
    - localtime : [default: false (use UTC)] whether or not the timestamps in backup files is formatted according to the host's local time.

## How to name rotated files 
File opens or creates the file on first Write. If the file exists and is less than MaxSize megabytes, fileexporter will open and append to that file.

If the file exists and its size is >= MaxSize megabytes,**the file is renamed by putting the current time in a timestamp** 
in the name immediately before the file's extension (or the end of the filename if there's no extension).
**A new telemetry file will be created using original filename.**

For example,  if your filename is `data.json`, when the file exists and its size is >= MaxSize megabytes, this file will be renamed to `data-2022-09-14T05-02-14.173.json`, and a new telemetry file created with `data.json`.

## Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  file:
    path: ./file.json
  file/2:
    path: ./filename.json
    rotation:
      max_size: 10
      max_days: 3
      max_backups: 3
      localtime: true
```
