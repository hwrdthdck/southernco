# SignalFx Metrics Exporter

This exporter can be used to send metrics to SignalFx.

Apart from metrics, the exporter is also capable of sending metric metadata
(properties and tags) to SignalFx. Currently, only metric metadata updates from
the [k8s_cluster receiver](../../receiver/k8sclusterreceiver/README.md) are
supported.

The following configuration options are required:

- `access_token` (no default): The access token is the authentication token
  provided by SignalFx.
- Either `realm` or both `api_url` and `ingest_url`. Both `api_url` and
  `ingest_url` take precedence over `realm`. See below for more information.

The following configuration options can also be configured:

- `access_token_passthrough`: (default = `true`) Whether to use
  `"com.splunk.signalfx.access_token"` metric resource label, if any, as the
  SignalFx access token.  In either case this label will be dropped during
  final translation.  Intended to be used in tandem with identical
  configuration option for [SignalFx
  receiver](../../receiver/signalfxreceiver/README.md) to preserve datapoint
  origin.
- `api_url` (no default): Destination to which SignalFx [properties and
  tags](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/metrics-metadata/metrics-metadata.html#metrics-metadata)
  are sent. If `realm` is set, this option is derived and will be
  `https://api.{realm}.signalfx.com/`. If a value is explicitly set, the value
  of `realm` will not be used in determining `api_url`. The explicit value will
  be used instead.
- `headers` (no default): Headers to pass in the payload.
- `ingest_url` (no default): Destination where SignalFx metrics are sent. If
  `realm` is set, this option is derived and will be
  `https://ingest.{realm}.signalfx.com/v2/datapoint`.  If a value is explicitly
  set, the value of `realm` will not be used in determining `ingest_url`. The
  explicit value will be used instead. If path is not specified,
  `/v2/datapoint` is used.
- `log_dimension_updates` (default = `false`): Whether or not to log dimension
  updates.
- `realm` (no default): SignalFx realm where the data will be received.
- `send_compatible_metrics` (default = `false`): Whether metrics must be
  translated to a format backward-compatible with SignalFx naming conventions.
- `timeout` (default = 5s): Amount of time to wait for a send operation to
  complete.
- `translation_rules`: Set of rules on how to translate metrics to a SignalFx 
  compatible format. Rules defined in `translation/constants.go` are used by 
  default. Applicable only when `send_compatible_metrics` set to `true`.
- `sync_host_metadata`: Defines whether the exporter should scrape host metadata
  and send it as property updates to SignalFx backend. Disabled by default.
  IMPORTANT: Host metadata synchronization relies on `resourcedetection` 
  processor. If this option is enabled make sure that `resourcedetection` 
  processor is enabled in the pipeline with one of the cloud provider detectors
  or environment variable detector setting a unique value to `host.name` attribute 
  within your k8s cluster. And keep `override=true` in resourcedetection config.

Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  signalfx:
    access_token: <replace_with_actual_access_token>
    access_token_passthrough: true
    headers:
      added-entry: "added value"
      dot.test: test
    realm: us1
    timeout: 5s
```

Beyond standard YAML configuration as outlined in the sections that follow,
exporters that leverage the net/http package (all do today) also respect the
following proxy environment variables:

* HTTP_PROXY
* HTTPS_PROXY
* NO_PROXY

If set at Collector start time then exporters, regardless of protocol,
will or will not proxy traffic as defined by these environment variables.
