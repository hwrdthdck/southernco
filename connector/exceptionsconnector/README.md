Extract metrics and logs from [recorded exceptions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/exceptions/) from spans.
<!-- end autogenerated section -->

## Overview

Each metric will have _at least_ the following dimensions because they are common across all spans:
- Service name
- Span kind
- Status code
- Exception message
- Exception type

## Configurations

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

The following settings can be optionally configured:
- `dimensions`: the list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions defined above.
  
  Each additional dimension is defined with a `name` which is looked up in the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes.

## Examples

The following is a simple example usage of the `exceptions` connector.

For configuration examples on other use cases, please refer to [More Examples](#more-examples).

The full list of settings exposed for this connector are documented [here](../../connector/exceptionsconnector/config.go).
