  It is replaced by:

    1. Sending to a new collector endpoint that does not require the
    hostname parameter.

    2. Recognizing the "host.name" resource attribute and using that
    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.
